# Let's assign seats randomly!

Update: this needs to be updated!

## The Programme  
Imagine a conference room filled with tables and each table has a number of seats. Now imagine some people are going to this conference and we want to assign a seat to each of them randomly. How do we do that?  
  
Luckily you don't have to deal with it manually, because it is what the _this_ programme does! It even goes so far as to renew the assignment every time you run the programme.  
  
## The Main Features  
📥 The programme takes a filepath as an argument to load the names of the people.  
🪑 The programme distributes the people to existing tables and returns how many seats are left.  
🧮 The programme deals with the possibility of having too many people in the room.  
  
## The Extra Features  
The programme...  
📝 allows the possibility to define the room setup from a config.json file  
🚁 allows the possibility to change dynamically the setup and re-run the program  
👯‍♀️ is dynamic and interactive so you can add a new person in the room and add a table if all tables are occupied  
🤹🏽 rearranges the seating in case someone is alone at a table  
📮 recognises requests such as "I (don't) want to be seated with this person at the table!"  
🗝️ gives answers to questions:  
  - How many seats are there in the room?  
  - How many people are there in the room?  
  - How many seats are free?
